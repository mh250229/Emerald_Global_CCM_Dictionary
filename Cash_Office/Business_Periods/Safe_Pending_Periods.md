## Safe Pending Periods
Safe Pending Period displays Safe Business Periods that have not been approved. Stores can have several pending business periods simultaneously and you can modify and view each business period if required.
Business Periods are approved after the accounts are balanced or the management are satisfied with the 'Over' or 'Short' amount generated after the last declaration was performed.
