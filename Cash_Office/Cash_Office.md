# Cash Office

Manage configuration related to cash maintenance activities performed at the store including opening funds, account profiles and more.

The cash office activities are:

* **Tender Pickup** - Pick up money from the POS terminal and record it in the system. Money is picked up for various reasons, such as End of Shift, or to prevent excessive amounts of money accumulating in the cash drawer during trading.
* **Tender Loan** - Replenish the money at the POS terminal (that might have decreased due to paying out change for example) during the business day.  This is performed at the beginning of a new period. A sum of money is transferred from the Safe to the accountability of the POS terminal. The Add Loan (Float) enables cashiers to return change to customers during trading.
* **Till Declaration** - Declare the money in the drawer at the POS terminal. Till Declarations are performed during trading, as well as part of the Till balancing process.
* **Paid In** - Record money from an outside source, other than direct sales. For example, rent received. The money is transferred to the safe or a till, automatically increasing the In-Safe totals.
* **Paid Out** - Record money payments made from the Store's safe or from one of the tills, and given to an outside source for goods or services. For example, a Window Cleaner would be paid for services via a Payout transaction. Performing a Payout automatically decreases the In Safe totals.
* **Bank Deposit** - Record money transferred from the safe to the bank, automatically decreasing the In-safe totals.
* **Bank Receipt** - Record money that was receive from the bank, automatically increasing the In-safe totals. Once a Receipt has been recorded, the accountability of the money is transferred to the Safe.
* **Safe Declaration** - Declare the money in the safe. Safe Declarations are performed during trading, as well as part of the Safe Balancing process.
* **Safe Transfer** - Record money transferred from one safe to another safe. For example, money can be transferred from the main safe to the bank safe before the money is deposited in the bank.
