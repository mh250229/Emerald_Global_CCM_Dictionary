## Account Profiles

**Account Profiles** specify the cash office activities that can be performed with a cash office account.  Each Account Profile has a set of predefined source and target cash office activities relevant to the selected account type. On linking a profile to a cash office account, only the activities defined in the profile are permitted using the linked cash office account. Account Profiles are mandatory and are linked to Cash Office accounts when creating a new Cash Office account.

For example, the Store Safe account can be used as the target and source for bank deposit, bank receipt, and safe transfer activities, whereas the Loan Safe account can be used as a source only for Tender Loans.

When creating a Cash Office account, you can select an Account Profile, and automatically apply the activities defined in the profile, without having to specify the activities for each Cash Office account separately.

Cash Office Accounts are used when performing activities with the different media that are transferred in or out of the store, or within the store.
