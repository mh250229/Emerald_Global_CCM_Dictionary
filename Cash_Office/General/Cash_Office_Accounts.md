## Cash Office Accounts

**Cash Office Accounts** is used to set up a list of accounts used to perform activities with the different media that is transferred in or out of the store, and within the store.  This option enables the user to reference the source and target of the cash office activities being performed.

Each account can be linked to a selected account profile, which includes the permitted cash office activities, and the locations in which the defined account is active.

For example, the Store Safe account can be used as the target and source for all activities, except for Till/POS Declarations, whereas the Bank account can only be used for Bank Deposits or Bank Receipts.
In addition, you can map a touchpoint group to a Safe Account, specifying that all money received and removed from the touchpoints in the associated Touchpoint group is transferred to and from a specific safe.
