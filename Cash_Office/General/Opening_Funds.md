## Opening Funds

**Opening Funds** defines the sum of money transferred from the safe to the POS touch point, known as the Opening Fund (a.k.a. Opening Loan). The Opening Fund is the predefined amount of money placed in each of the tills prior to a new business period and enables cashiers to return change to customers during trading.

Open Fund configuration is validated when cash office activities linked to a specific business date or balance period are performed automatically.  For example, the system is configured to record an opening fund of $500.00 each day to each POS terminal. When the system reconciles and balances the POS terminal, the opening fund amount is deducted.

|**Method**|The method used to configure the Opening Loan.<BR>The options are:<BR><BR>**Open Loan** - The opening loan amount is automatically transferred to the Till touch points at the beginning of a business period.<BR>If a declaration was performed before the business period was closed, the opening amount is the actual amount recorded from the last declaration.<BR>If no declaration was performed, the amount is the system expected amount. The predefined automatic opening loan amount is recorded at first sign-in or at EOD.  This is recorded as a tender loan activity.<BR>For example:<BR>The Predefined Amount is configured as $300.00.<BR>On Day 1, Cashier 1 performs transactions on POS 1, and performs a declaration of $586.12 and then performs additional transactions (the new expected amount is $1099)<BR>On Day 1, Cashier 2 does transactions on POS 2 and at the end of the day does not do any declaration. The Expected amount at this stage is $656.24<BR>EOD is executed and a new Till period is created.<BR>The two drawers are reconciled during Day 1 and Day 2.<BR>On Day 2, for POS 1, the Opening amount corresponds to the amount of the declaration of the previous day of $586.12 (Expected amount = $586.12)<BR>On Day 2 for POS 2, the Opening amount corresponds to the Expected amount of the previous day of $656.24 (Expected amount = $656.24)<BR>On first sign-in at POS 1 and POS 2, the Open loan is triggered and the $300 open loan is added to the drawer. Result is<BR>POS 1 Expected amount = $886.12<BR>POS 2 Expected amount = $956.24<BR>**Carry Over** - During the End of Day process, this amount is carried over to the new business period as the opening loan amount of the POS terminal.   (I.e.- a ‘Carried Over’ figure).  If there was a declaration in the last Business Period, the most actual declaration is carried over to the next Business Period. If there was no declaration in the last Business Period, the system expected amount is carried over.<BR>**Manual Start Shift Add Loan** -<BR>**Note:** For Cash Office to reflect correct balancing, a technical ‘System Pickup’ activity is recorded by the system during the ‘End of day’ process and before changing the business date , and a new opening loan is recorded (an additional one) right after the business date is changed.|
|**Triggering Event**|The event or activity which triggers the Opening Loan method. <BR>The options are:<BR><BR>**None** - The Opening Loan method is not triggered<br>**After end of day** - The Opening Loan method is triggered after the EOD process is run. <br>**On sign in** - The Opening Loan method is triggered after the cashier signs in at the first shift.|
