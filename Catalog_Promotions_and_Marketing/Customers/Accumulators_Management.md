## Accumulators Management

**Accumulators Management** defines the member accounts used to accumulate and count points earned and redeemed by customers.

For example, when a loyalty card is scanned, the system retrieves the accumulators balances and manages points earned or redeemed within the stores.

Points, bonus points, monthly savings, yearly visits, etc. can be accumulated in the Customer Accounts.

On setting up a promotion, you can select the member account you want to use to link to the promotion.
