## Incentive Rules

**Incentive Rules** are the rules that trigger Incentive Messages, informing the customers they are about to reach a promotion's threshold and could receive a reward if they meet the promotion conditions.

Each Incentive Rule has a threshold percentage or quantity completion condition which triggers the incentive message. For example, if the threshold is defined as 80%, on reaching 80% of the promotion condition threshold, the incentive message is displayed or printed.

For example, if the promotion Spend $50.00 and Get $10.00 Off the total ticket is defined with an incentive message, and the completion threshold is 80%, the incentive engine will trigger the message when the customer has spent $40.00 informing them that if they spend an additional $10.00, a reward is issued.

Incentive messages are used at convenience stores or at the touchpoint where the retailer wants to offer promotions, and for continuity purposes, e.g., spend $500.00 during July and get a reward. The messages are triggered when the cashier totals the ticket.

Incentive messages can only be defined for POS and self-checkout touchpoints.

Incentive Rules are only applied to promotions which are configured with an Incentive Message reward. Once the Incentive rules are identified by the Incentive Engine and validated, the incentive message is displayed.

The Incentive Message engine validates that all the rules that trigger the message are met and handles optimization. For example, the engine validates the percentage of the threshold that was met to trigger the promotion and the incentive message.
