## Promotions

**Promotions** is based on a flexible building blocks concept. The Promotion Manager’s building blocks enable you to create very simple to very complex promotions. The Promotion Manager includes a  Toolbox feature with Criteria, Reward, Financial, Controls and Restrictions, and Market Attribute options.

The toolbox options contain boxes of functions. Each box contributes to the vast array of dynamic features and functions from which you can build your promotion. On selecting a function, it is applied with a default value, making set up very easy and efficient. The concept brings a fresh approach with an unlimited range of combinations to build any promotion.

For example, a basic promotion can include one criterion and one reward, for example, Buy 1 Chocolate bar, Get 1 Free, whereas a complex promotion may include a range of criteria and even more than one reward, e.g., Buy 1 Chocolate bar, and spend a minimum of $50.00 in the ticket and Get 1 Free and Earn 500 points this visit. The options are endless.

All this functionality is made available by the Promotion Engine with its extensive capabilities in order to create promotions fully compliant with customization.

The Promotion engine enables the integral capabilities of the Promotion Manager to support the full cycle from promotion setup at the central office, store level, online distribution of promotions to all or selected stores, and executing the promotions at the time of checkout. The promotion manager also supports importing different promotions from 3rd party systems.

Part of the roadmap is to define a unique functionality where templates can be built for the different promotion types, which save setup and maintenance time. This functionality will be elaborated on in future versions.

Currently, Loyalty is integrated on a very low level, enabling the option to link promotions to segments and member accounts. In future releases, the Promotion Manager will integrate fully with the Loyalty and Promotion Engine.

Apportionment can also be defined according to the user’s requirements.
