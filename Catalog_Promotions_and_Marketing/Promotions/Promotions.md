## Promotions

**Promotions** is based on a flexible building blocks concept. The Promotion Manager’s building blocks enable you to create very simple to very complex promotions. The Promotion Manager includes a  Toolbox feature with Criteria, Reward, Financial, Controls and Restrictions, and Market Attribute options.

The toolbox options contain boxes of functions. Each box contributes to the vast array of dynamic features and functions from which you can build your promotion. On selecting a function, it is applied with a default value, making set up very easy and efficient. The concept brings a fresh approach with an unlimited range of combinations to build any promotion.

For example, a basic promotion can include one criterion and one reward, for example, Buy 1 Chocolate bar, Get 1 Free, whereas a complex promotion may include a range of criteria and even more than one reward, e.g., Buy 1 Chocolate bar, and spend a minimum of $50.00 in the ticket and Get 1 Free and Earn 500 points this visit. The options are endless.

All this functionality is made available by the Promotion Engine with its extensive capabilities in order to create promotions fully compliant with customization.

The Promotion engine enables the integral capabilities of the Promotion Manager to support the full cycle from promotion setup at the central office, store level, online distribution of promotions to all or selected stores, and executing the promotions at the time of checkout. The promotion manager also supports importing different promotions from 3rd party systems.

Part of the roadmap is to define a unique functionality where templates can be built for the different promotion types, which save setup and maintenance time. This functionality will be elaborated on in future versions.

Currently, Loyalty is integrated on a very low level, enabling the option to link promotions to segments and member accounts. In future releases, the Promotion Manager will integrate fully with the Loyalty and Promotion Engine.

Apportionment can also be defined according to the user’s requirements.

|Type|The threshold option by which items must be purchased to trigger the promotion. This field is mandatory.<br>The options are:<br>**Units** - The item must be purchased in single units. E.g., Buy 4 Cokes Get Reward<br>**Spend** - The promotion is triggered by the amount spent on items or in the ticket. For example, spend $10.00 on the specified items.

The Required Minimum Value Of value is 6, and the Reward Calculation starts from min value field is set to No.<br>The promotion is triggered when the customer purchases 6 Cokes.<br>If the Reward Calculation starts from min value is set to Yes, the customer must purchase 10 Cokes to trigger the promotion.<br>**Note:** The Reward Calculation starts from min value field is enabled only when a value is entered in the Required Minimum Value Of field.|
|Condition Required Once Per Ticket|Indicates that the condition is validated only once in the transaction. For example, Scan coupon and Coke Get $1.00 Off. If selected, the customer is required to scan only one coupon and then they receive a reward for each Coke scanned. If not selected, the customer must present a coupon for each coke scanned.|
|Limit by Item Price|Applies a promotion on items according to their prices, enabling you to prevent reducing the item’s price below a specified threshold.<BR>For example, you can configure a promotion on the same item and give double discounts, but not give more than a defined amount.<BR>Example:<BR>Promotion 1 - Buy Apples ($5.00 per Kg). If the price is between $10.00 and $14.00, get the New Price $10.00.<BR>Promotion 2 – Buy Apples ($5.00 per Kg).

This is the default value.|
|UOM Quantity/ Reward Calculation on Threshold Value|Indicates that the reward specified in the promotions is applied to the UOM quantity defined in the Value field, or to the entire purchased quantity.<br>If selected, the reward is calculated on the last rounded triggering amount, i.e., if the amount defined in the Value field is 10kg and the customer purchases 11kg, the reward is given on the 10Kg, and the remaining 1 Kg is calculated at the original price.<br>If not selected, the reward is calculated on the entire purchased amount.<br>For example:<br>The store is running the following promotions:<br>Promotion 1 - Buy 3 kg of Bananas, Get 10% Off. The Round to Last Trigger Level field is set to No.<br>Promotion 2 - Buy 4 kg Apples, Get 20% Off. The Round to Last Trigger Level field is set to Yes.<br>The Customer buys 3.5 kg Bananas ($7.00 Total ) and 4.5 kg Apples ($9.00 Total).<br>The reward is calculated as follows:<br>Promotion 1 - the reward is calculated on the entire purchased weight of the bananas (3.5 kg), e.g., 10% x $7.00 = $0.70<br>Promotion 2 - the reward is calculated only on the amount defined in the promotion threshold value (4 kg), e.g., 20% x $8.00 = $2.30<br>**Note:** The Reward Calculation on Threshold Value field is enabled only when UOM Quantity is selected in the Type field.|
|Spend Amount||
|Round to the Smallest Monetary Unit|Indicates if the amount spent by the customer on items in the promotion is rounded to the nearest multiple of the smallest defined monetary unit. The monetary unit is a fixed number which represents the smallest available coin in the local currency, and is defined in the system parameters.<BR>For example, a Spend $10.00 Get 10% off promotion is running in the store. The smallest monetary unit is 0.05. The customer spends $9.98. If the Round Spend to the Smallest Monetary Unit field is set to Yes, the amount the customer spent ($9.98) is rounded to $10.00 and the promotion is triggered.<BR>Promotion funding and apportionment do not take the rounding into account. The reward is applied to the actual amount and apportionment is performed on the actual item price.<BR>**Note:** The Round Spend to the Smallest Monetary Unit field is enabled only when Spend is selected in the Type field.|
|Consider Gross Price|Indicates that the gross price of the promotion is considered when validating that the promotion conditions are met.<BR>For example, the following promotions are running in the store:<BR>Promotion 1 - Buy a Tea Tray get $4 off<BR>Promotion 2 - Spend $10.00 Get$1.00 off<BR>The Consider Gross Price parameter is set to Yes in Promotion 2.<BR>A Tea Tray costs $10.00.<BR>Scenario:<BR>The customer purchases 1 Tea Tray.<BR>Promotion 1 runs and according to the default priority order reduces the balance due to $6.00 and giving a reward of $4.00.<BR>Promotion 2 runs, and the reward is applied to the gross price ($10.00) giving a reward of $1.00.<BR>The customer receives a total reward of $5.00.<BR>**Note:** If the Consider Gross Price parameter is set to No in Promotion 2, the promotion reward is issued on the item price after Promotion 1 was triggered, i.e., $6.00, and the customer does not receive a reward since they did not spend $10.00.|
|Consider item without modifiers|Indicates that the modifiers are not considered when validating the item when the promotion conditions are met.|
|Apply Reward On All Basket Items|Indicates that the promotion discount is calculated on all the items in the basket.<BR>If not selected, promotion discount is calculated on the maximum amount item.<BR>The field is enabled only when Spend is selected from the Purchase Type drop-down list in the Basket Drawer.|

|Intersection|To trigger on items in a promotion basket with And/Or logic. This enables retailers to reward customers who purchase specific brand items in specific departments.<br>The AND/OR logic is implemented by Intersections. An Intersection is a Group tag applied to an entity (Hierarchy/Group/Item). All intersections defined with the same Group tag are conditions that must be met to trigger the promotion, and entities with the same tag use the AND logic.  Entities with different tags use the OR logic.<br><br>For example:<br><br>Perfume Hierarchy - includes all perfumes of all brands.<br>Chanel Group - includes all Chanel Products (both perfumes, skin care, makeup.)<br>Lancome Group - includes all Lancome Products (both perfumes, skin care, makeup.)<br><br>To set up a promotion on a Chanel Perfume, you must apply the same intersection to the Perfume hierarchy and the Chanel Group. Only items in both the unique perfume hierarchy and the unique Chanel group will trigger the promotion, e.g., Chanel Perfume.<br>You can also set up intersections for more than one criteria within the basket, for example,  Buy from 'Perfume Hierarchy AND 'Zero Tax" hierarchy OR from the Chanel Group AND Lipstick group, Get 10% off.<br>Scenario 1:<br>Buy from 'Perfume' hierarchy AND 'Chanel' group, Get 10% off<br>Sale 1 - The customer purchases a bottle of Chanel perfume. The promotion is triggered.<br>Sale 2 - The customer purchases a bottle of Lancome perfume.

E.g., enter 3, to specify that is the number of items the customer must purchase.<br>**Reward Value**- The reward value, e.g., enter 2 to indicate a new price of $2.00 or 2% Off|
|Redeem from Member Account|Indicates that monetary rewards are given against points accumulated in Member Accounts. When selected, the following fields are displayed:<br>**Member Account** – The Member Account from which the points are redeemed.<br>**Redeem Value** – The value redeemed during the promotion. The value is a value per redemption. For example, if the promotion is configured to give $5 off, and the number of points to redeem is configured as 2, if the promotion is triggered 4 times, the customer receives $20 discount and 8 points are deducted from the selected member account.<br>**Redeem Once Per Ticket** - the number of points redeemed in a promotion is deducted from the member account only once per ticket, and not each time the promotion is triggered.<br>For example, a promotion rewarding the Loyalty customers with $0.10 Off per liter of fuel purchased is running.

The promotion reward is not deducted from the item price and does not reduce the store’s revenue. It is accounted for as a tender paid by the customer.<BR>Only promotions with a monetary reward can be setup to calculate the reward as a tender. The promotion represents the tender, which pays for the item.<BR>For example:<BR>Pay with a Visa card for a computer on sale in the store and get 5% discount. Visa covers the computer price.<BR>Staff Discount as a Tender - the Retailer may give their employees a defined percentage off all their purchases. When an employee purchases items, and the employee card is swiped before the transaction, the reward amount does not reduce the retailer's revenue by reducing the items price, but instead is reported as a special Staff Discount Tender.<BR>Another example is Coupon as tender. A coupon may be considered a tender and therefore trigger a promotion with a reward as tender.<BR>For example, the store is running a promotion Buy 3 Bottles of Wine, Present a Coupon and Get the New Price of $10.00 instead of $27.00. The Coupon amount is recorded to the rewarding tender.  This enables the user to follow up all discounts given on a specific reward, i.e., coupons.<BR>Rewarding Tenders can accumulate a range of reward types, amount off, percent off, new price, etc.|

|**Member Account**|Specifies that the reward is Member points, which are accumulated in the Members Account, and can be redeemed at a later date. In addition, you can also reward customers by increasing points accumulated in a Member Account, and decreasing the points in another. This flexibility enables you to support promotions in which you move points from one account to another account, for example, if a customer purchases a case of coke and has 100 points in their Points Account, you can define a promotion that decreases the 100 points in their Points Account and increases their Double Bonus Points Account by 200 Points, i.e., converting 1 point into 2 bonus points.<BR>An additional promotion may be running, which rewards the customers with coupons for every 20 Double Bonus Points redeemed, and so on.<BR>This reward is only applicable for Loyalty customers.|

E.g., enter 3, to specify that is the number of items the customer must purchase.<BR>**Reward Value** - The reward value, e.g., enter 2 to indicate a new price of $2.00 or 2% Off.|
|Exclude from Tender Optimization|Specifies if the promotion participates in Tender Optimization. Tender Optimization is a type of conflict, which ensures that if more than one promotion is triggered in a transaction, the customer is rewarded with the maximum number of points.<BR>For example, a customer partially pays for their items in cash and partially with a tender, which is excluded from a points earning promotion. To give the customer the maximum points reward, the cash tender pays for items which contribute the most to the points accumulation.|
|Decrease Point|Specifies that the member points are deducted from the Member Account. This option is used when moving points from one account to another account, for example, if a customer purchases a case of coke and has 100 points in their Points Account, you can define a promotion that decreases the 100 points in their Points Account and increases their Double Bonus Points Account by 200 Points, i.e., converting 1 point into 2 bonus points.

For example, Get 10% Off One of the following Drinks (Coke, Sprite, Fanta). If the customer purchases Coke, the discount is allocated to the Coke (Reward Item).<BR>**All items included in the promotion setup** - applies the discount allocation to all the items in the promotion.<BR>**Department** - applies the reward calculation to a basket of items. If more than one basket is linked to a promotion, you can select the baskets you want to allocate the promotion reward.

![Controls & Restrictions Screen](/Images/ControlsAndRestrictionsScreen.png)

|**Field**|**Description**|
|---------|----------|
|**Redemption Limit**|The redemption limitations applied to the promotion.|
|Limitation Period|Specifies the redemption limitations applied to the promotion.<BR>The options are:<BR>**Ticket Limit** - the promotion redemption limit is per transaction.  For example, in one transaction the customer may be limited to redeem up to 100 points, or if the reward is a free item, the customer may be limited to receive the reward only once per transaction.<BR>**Days** - the promotion redemption limit is per day or number of days. When selected the No of Days field is displayed to enter the number of days the promotion redemptions are limited to.<BR>For example, if the No of Days is 30, and the Limit Value is 5, the customer can redeem the promotion five times in 30 days.<BR>**Total** - the number of promotion redemptions is not limited to a specific time period. The system only takes into account the promotion expiry date. For example, you can specify that the customer can redeem the promotion five times.|
|Limit Value|The number of promotion redemptions limited in the selected Limitation Period.|
|UOM Quantity Limit|Limits the UOM quantity rewarded in a ticket when there is no limit on the number of redemptions.<BR>For example, you can set up a promotion to Get a New Price of $4.00 per kilo, and limit the reward to 5 kg in the ticket. If the customer bought 10 kg, the customer is rewarded only 5 kg. The limitation can be defined per ticket, total amount, or days.<BR>A UOM Quantity Limit can be applied to the current ticket or multiple transactions for loyalty members (Days, Total). For example, limit to 5Kg in 1 day, or limit to 5 kg in total.<BR>The UOM limit is applicable only for Amount Off, Percent Off, New Price and Free Item rewards.|
|Limitation Period|The redemption limitations applied to the promotion.<BR>The options are:<BR>**Ticket Limit** - The UOM Quantity is limit is per transaction. For example, the customer may be limited to receive a reward on up to 5 kg only in a transaction.<BR>**Days** - The UOM Quantity is limited per day or number of days. For example, the customer may be limited to receive a reward up to 5 kg per day. When selected the No of Days field is displayed to enter the number of days the promotion redemptions are limited to.<BR>For example, The number of days the UOM Quantity is limited to. For example, if the No of Days is 10, and the Limit Value is 5, the customer is limited to purchase 5 kg in 10 days.<BR>**Total** - The UOM Quantity is limited to a specified amount. For example, the customer may be limited to receive a reward on a total of 5 kg.|
|Limit Value|The amount the UOM Quantity is limited to. For example, if you enter 5, the promotion redemption is limited to 5 kg.|
|Conflict and Priority|Defines conflict participation for each promotion. You can specify which promotions participate in promotion conflicts, and which promotions are excluded from promotion conflicts.<BR>Promotion conflicts occur when there is more than one promotion offering different rewards on the same items. The Conflict Management rules aim to optimize customer rewards, while minimizing the option of giving double rewards on items that trigger more than one promotion. Any item that can trigger a promotion on its own can participate in Conflict Management.<BR>In addition, you can assign a promotion to a Promotion Group. The Promotion engine resolves promotion conflicts between promotions linked to the same Conflict Group. <BR>For example:<BR>A customer purchases two cokes, with the following two promotions in the system:<BR>The first promotion has the condition that when purchasing two cokes, the customer is rewarded with one free coke. <BR>The second promotion has the condition that when purchasing two cokes, the customer is rewarded with 25% off the second coke.<BR>In the case where both promotions are not assigned to the same Conflict Group, then the customer is rewarded twice. The customer is rewarded with one coke free, and also rewarded with 25% off the second coke.<BR>In the case where both promotions are assigned to the same Conflict Group, only one of the promotions is triggered for each instance of an item.<BR>This means, that each item (instance) is allocated to one promotion. The items allocation between the promotions, depends on what the best reward is for the customer. In this case, the best reward value available to the customer is achieved by allocating both cokes to the first promotion, and rewarding the customer with a free coke (i.e. The reward value is higher than receiving 2*25% off).|
|Promotion Group|The ID the Promotion Group assigned to the promotion to handle promotion conflicts. If there is a conflict between two promotions linked to the same Promotion Group, the Promotion Engine resolves the conflict, and rewards the customer according to the priority and strategy defined for the Promotion Group.|
|Allow Partial Reward|Indicates that the promotion reward is partially issued.<BR>If not selected, the promotion reward must be fully issued.<BR>For example, a promotion Buy 6 bottles of wine and Get 10% Off is running in the store. If the customer buys the 6 bottles of wine, the full reward of 10% is issued.<BR>Items rewarded in this scenario can also be used to trigger additional promotions in the same promotion group in which this option is set Yes.<BR>However, items which have already triggered a promotion cannot be used to trigger another promotion in which the reward was fully issued.<BR>If selected, the promotion reward can be partially issued.<BR>For example, if in addition to the above promotion, a 'Buy 8 bottles of wine and Get 5%' promotion is defined, when the customer buys 8 bottles of wine, all the 8 bottles of wine can be used to trigger the promotion even though 6 bottles have already triggered a promotion.<BR>However, the reward is only given on the bottles of wine not previously rewarded, i.e., the additional 2 bottles.<BR>If an item has already triggered a promotion, it cannot be used to trigger a promotion that was fully rewarded.|
|Exclude promoted items|Specifies if items which triggered a promotion are excluded from triggering another promotion in the same ticket.<BR>If selected, the promotion is triggered only by items that have not triggered another promotion.<BR>For example, the following two promotions are set in the store:<BR>Buy A get $1.00 Off<BR>10% on your ticket<BR>The customer buys items A and B.<BR>The cashier scans Item A, and the first promotion is triggered.<BR>The cashier scans Item B, and the second promotion is triggered. The second promotion applies only on Item B since Item A is participated in the previous promotion.|
|**Reward Limit**|Specifies the promotion reward limits.|
|Include Reward Limit|Indicates that the user can apply the redemption limits to the promotion. When selected, the Limitation Period and Limit Value are enabled to allow the user to define the promotion limitation period and value.<BR>The **Include Reward Limit** field is displayed only when the **Pay By Points Promotion** checkbox is selected in the **Reward/Amount Off ##section.|
|Limitation Period|The redemption limitations applied to the promotion.<BR>The options are:<BR>**Ticket Limit** - indicates that the promotion reward limit is per transaction.  For example, in one transaction the customer may be limited to a reward of up to 100 points, or if the reward is a free item, the customer may be limited to receive the reward only once.<BR>**Days** - indicates that the promotion redemption limit is per day or number of days. When selected the No of Days field is displayed to enter the number of days the promotion rewards are limited to.<BR>**Total** - indicates that the number of promotion rewards is not limited to a specific time period. The system only takes into account the promotion expiry date, for example, you can specify that the customer can receive a promotion reward five times.<BR><BR>**Note**: The **Limitation Period** and **Limit Value** fields are disabled for **Pay By Points Promotions**. See the **Include Reward Limit** field above.|
|Limit Value|The number of promotion rewards limited in the selected Limitation Period.|
