The Emerald Global CCM (Central Configuration Management) allows users to manage business configuration. It supports a deployment (cloud and windows), consists of a REACT Web application, and a Node JS service (Back End For Front End (BFF)).  
The CCM enables defining the necessary configurations to perform selling, and once the Emerald Global CCM configuration is performed, it drives the flows on the POS touchpoints.  
The CCM cloud base application utilizes a set of services that provide the “POS In The Cloud” capabilities.  
All configurations are automatically downloaded from the Emerald Global CCM to the Stores and touchpoints.
