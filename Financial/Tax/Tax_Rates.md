## Tax Rates

**Tax Rates** define tax rates or codes. Often there are special tax rates on certain items to comply with government rules and regulations.

Tax rates may differ in different locations, and you can link different taxes to specific locations. Tax rates can be calculated by different methods. Emerald Global supports fixed, percent, Multi Tiered, Top Tiers, Multi Tiered Brackets, and Top Tiered Brackets and Brackets tax calculation methods.

Tiered taxes enable tax authorities to apply different tax rates to an item, according to the rates per tier.  In addition, the tax can be calculated per tier and the relevant tax bracket.

A unique tax engine calculates taxes during the transaction based on predefined configuration.

|Method|The method used to calculate the tax.  The form is dynamic, and on selecting any of the Tier options, the Value, Inclusive, Rounding Method, and Indicator fields are not displayed. In place, the Product Amount grid is displayed, which enables you to define the tax tiers.<BR>The options are:<BR><BR>**Percent** - to calculate the tax as a percentage of the item price, e.g., 5%.<BR>**Fixed** - to calculate the tax as a fixed amount, which is not dependent on the item price, e.g., $1.50. When selected, the tax value is not rounded.<BR>**Multi Tiered** - to calculate the tax by applying the tax amount defined for each tier in the Tax Table to the part of the item price which corresponds to each tier.<BR>Tiers are the tax levels within a Tax Rate with different tax amounts which are applied according to the item price.<BR>For example, an item is sold for $100.00.  A tax rate including 3 tiers is applied to the item.<BR>A 10% tax rate is applied to the item price from $0.00-$20.00, 15% is applied to the item price from $21.00-$80.00, and a 10% tax rate is applied to the item price from $81.00-$100.00.<BR>The tax is calculated as follows:<BR>$20.00 * 10% = $2.00<BR>$60.00 * 15% = $9.00<BR>$20.00 * 10%=$2.00<BR>The total tax amount is $13.00.<BR>**Top Tier** - to calculate the tax by applying the tax amount defined for the tier in the Tax Tier table which corresponds to the item price. One tax rate is applied to the full item price.<BR>Tiers are the tax levels within a Tax Rate with different tax amounts which are applied according to the item price.<BR>For example, an item is sold for $100.00. A tax rate including 3 tiers is applied to the item.<BR>In this example, a tier with a 10% tax rate is defined for items with a price between $81 - $100.00.<BR>The tax is calculated as follows:<BR>$100.00 \* 10% = $10.00.<BR>The total tax amount is $10.00.<BR>**Multi Tiered Brackets** - to calculate the tax by applying the multi tiered method on a specific amount of the item price and applying the tax rates defined in the tax brackets table to the remaining amount.  See Tax Brackets.<BR>**Top Tier Brackets** - to calculate the tax by applying the Top Tier method on a specific amount of the item price and applying the tax rates defined in the tax brackets table to the remaining amount. See Tax Brackets.<BR>**Brackets** - to calculate the tax by applying the tax bracket calculation method. Tax Brackets define the cut off amount for the tax rate and the tax amount applied to the remaining item price. See Tax Brackets.<BR>**Proportional Percentage** - a tax calculation method used to calculate the tax on Delivery fees. The tax method calculates the tax on the Delivery Fee proportioned between the items in the transaction based on the other tax rates applied to each item in the in the transaction, with apportionment to the relative amount of each tax rate.<BR>All delivery items (Delivery Fees) should be associated to a tax rate with the Proportional Percentage method.<BR>The Proportional Percentage Tax calculation method only calculates this tax for items associated to an Inclusive Tax rate with a Percentage Tax calculation method.<BR>On selecting the Proportional Percentage method, the following applies:<BR>\* The Proportional Percentage method only calculates the tax for items that are defined as merchandise items. Items that are defined as non-merchandise items will be ignored in the tax calculation. Delivery Items must be defined as non-merchandise items.<BR>\* The Tax calculation on delivery items is on the Net Price after all discounts were applied.<BR>\* The Delivery item is recorded in the Tlog with all Tax Rates per all items included in the transaction with their relative amount. All delivery items should be associated to a tax rate with the Proportional Percentage method.<BR>\* The Total tax amount includes the delivery item tax and this is displayed in the Tlog and Receipt.<BR>\* The total tax amount, taxable amount, and total tax per tax rate include the delivery item tax amount, this is captured in the Tlog and displayed on the Receipt.<BR>Scenario:<BR>The Proportional Percentage method is used to calculate the tax on a Delivery Fee in a Transaction.<BR>Configuration:<BR>\*Apple linked to 6% tax rate, price including tax 15,00<BR>\* Beer linked to 21% tax rate, price including tax  30,00<BR>\* Cleaner linked to 0% tax rate, net price 5.00<BR>\* Deposit item linked to 0% tax rate, net price 2,10<BR>\* Delivery Fee (Item) - price 5,00.<BR>The Delivery Fee is apportioned per item as follows:<BR>Apple - 1.50<BR>Beer -3.00<BR>Cleaner - 0.50<BR>The system calculates the tax amount per item, and calculates the apportioned Delivery Fee per item according to the Delivery Fee amount, and from this calculates the Delivery Fee tax per apportioned Delivery Fee charged. The total tax amount per item is the line tax and Delivery Fee tax.<BR>1. At the POS, the cashier scans each of the following items:<BR>\* Apple<BR>\* Beer (the deposit item is automatically added)<BR>\* Cleaner<BR>\* Delivery Item<BR>2. The cashier selects OK to complete the transaction.<BR>The system records the following in the Tlog:<BR>The tax amount for the Delivery Item:<BR>\* 6% tax element - taxable amount $1.42 and Tax amount $0.08<BR>\* 21% tax element - taxable amount $2.48 and Tax amount $0.52<BR>\* 0% tax element - taxable amount $0.50 and Tax amount $0.00<BR>The Total Tax Amount, Taxable Amount and Total Tax per Tax Rate which includes the Delivery Item Tax Amount.<BR>\* 6% tax – total taxable amount $15.57 and Tax amount $0.93<BR>\* 21% tax – total taxable amount $27.27 and Tax amount $5.73<BR>\* 0% tax – total taxable amount $7.60 and Tax amount 0.00|

Otherwise rounded down.<BR>**Up** – The tax value is always rounded up (3rd decimal is truncated).<BR>**Down** – The tax value is always rounded down.|
|Indicator|Field displayed only if the method is set to fixed or percent.<BR>The symbol displayed on the touchpoint to indicate the tax. The symbol is displayed next to the product on which the tax is applied. Indicators are limited to one character.|
|Imposition|Field displayed only if the method is set to fixed or percent.<BR>The imposition reconciles any difference between the tax amount calculated per product and the tax amount calculated per transaction when tax amounts are aggregated and rounded.<BR>The system identifies the products with the highest tax and adds or reduces the imposition until the tax calculated per product equals the tax amount calculated for the transaction.<BR>If an imposition is not assigned, the system adjusts the tax amounts according to the tax Indicator. If neither an Indicator or Imposition is assigned, then the Rate ID is saved as the Imposition.|

|Coupon reduces tax amount|If checked, tax is calculated on the item after the coupon amount is deducted.<BR>If unchecked, tax is calculated on the full item price before the coupon amount is deducted from the item price. This is the default value.|
|**Additional Conditions drawer**||
|Compound tax|Calculate tax on top of other taxes, for example, if an item is defined with two taxes, one is inclusive, and the other is exclusive.<BR>When configuring the Compound Tax amount, the system prioritizes the taxes based on the Tax ID. Taxes are applied in sequential order from the lowest Tax ID to the highest.<BR>For example:<BR>The store sells a TV for $500.00. Two sales taxes are applied to the item:<BR>Tax 1 - 10%<BR>Tax 2 - 2 20%<BR>The system first calculates the tax amount based on Tax 1, and then calculates Tax 2 on the item price + Tax 1.<BR>TV     $500.00<BR>Tax 1  $50.00<BR>Tax 2  $12.10<BR>The TV is sold for $562.10. <BR>The Tax amount is $62.10.|
