## Currency Exchange Rates

**Currency Exchange Rates** define the foreign exchange rate for each tender not defined as the local currency. For example, if Euro is your local currency, you can define the exchange rates when customers pay with Dollars, Yen, and so on. Exchange rates are imported in a batch file from an external source and updated according to a defined time period.

At the touchpoint, cashiers can receive or withdraw different currencies to give change or accept payment from customers. The system can convert the different currencies accordingly. The total amount is always calculated according to the local currency against the foreign currency rate.

In addition, when performing Cash Office functions, such as Pickups, the cashier can select the different foreign currency tenders.
