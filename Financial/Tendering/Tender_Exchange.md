## Tender Exchange

**Tender Exchange** defines the tenders which can be purchased and paid with another tender, e.g., pay with Visa and get cash. For example, a customer may have purchased items and paid with cash, and then realize that they need the cash. The customer can then request to pay with a different tender, e.g., Visa. The cashier performs a tender exchange to replace the cash tender recorded in the ticket with the Visa tender that the customer wants to use.

There are various business motivations for Tender Exchange. For example:

* Cash withdrawal services from ATM machines - Customer pays with an EFT card and gets a refund with cash.
* Tender correction â€“ Customers pay with Visa for Goods and want to swap the payment with a different payment mean
