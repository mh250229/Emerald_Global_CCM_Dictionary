## Tenders

**Tenders** are methods of payment used in the stores, e.g., Mastercard, Visa, cash, etc.

You can create new tenders, as well as track tender criteria, such as the tender code, tender name and tender type, etc.

Tenders are defined centrally. On creating a new tender, you can define a range of different tender criteria, and specify any relevant exceptions. For example, specify that credit card tender is always the closing tender, or that cash tenders cannot be used to refund to customers. An exception can be applied to all or specific business units and touchpoint groups.

Tender Exceptions can be defined to modify tender attributes in specific locations and touchpoint groups. For example, specify that the drawer always opens when paying cash tender at the POS in one store and doesn't open in another store.
