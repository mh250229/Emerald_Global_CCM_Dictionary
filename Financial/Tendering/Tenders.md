## Tenders

**Tenders** are methods of payment used in the stores, e.g., Mastercard, Visa, cash, etc.

You can create new tenders, as well as track tender criteria, such as the tender code, tender name and tender type, etc.

Tenders are defined centrally. On creating a new tender, you can define a range of different tender criteria, and specify any relevant exceptions. For example, specify that credit card tender is always the closing tender, or that cash tenders cannot be used to refund to customers. An exception can be applied to all or specific business units and touchpoint groups.

Tender Exceptions can be defined to modify tender attributes in specific locations and touchpoint groups. For example, specify that the drawer always opens when paying cash tender at the POS in one store and doesn't open in another store.

In this scenario, the Cash Drawer will not be triggered to open|Cash, Voucher, CreditDebit, Check, Cheque, Mobile, Reward, Point Payment, Electronic Voucher, Rounding|
|Open Drawer|Indicates that the till drawer opens when completing a transaction with this tender. For example, Cash requires that the drawer opens, however a credit card may not.<BR>The options are:<BR><BR>**Always** - the Till Drawer always opens at the end of a transaction<BR>**When Receiving This Tender** - the Till Drawer opens only when the transaction is paid for using the defined tender<BR>**When Returning This Tender** - the Till Drawer opens only when the tender is returned to the customer during a transaction, e.g., change<BR>**Never** - the Till Drawer never opens|Cash, Voucher, CreditDebit, Check, Cheque, Mobile, Reward, Point Payment, Electronic Voucher, Rounding|

|Authorization Method|The authorization method used to validate the tender. The settings for this field are predefined and cannot be customized.<BR>The options are:<BR><BR>**None** - The tender is not processed by the EPS. When selected, you must select the validation required by the third-party provider to validate the card. See the 3rd Party Validations field.<BR>**Process with EPS** - The tender is processed by an External Payment System (EPS) which provides the definitions for external validation. The EPS's rules define if the tender is valid. Properties such as Validate Tender By, and Minimum Online Authorization amounts are validated externally by the EPS.<BR>**Process with Mobile** - Authorization is performed using the payment number issued by the mobile phone via the Mobile Shopper application. The payment number is used to bind the mobile shopper application to the specific POS at the specific store. Once the link is created, the POS sends the transaction details to the mobile phone. The transaction details and payment option are displayed on the mobile phone, and the customer confirms the payment using the PIN code. Once confirmed, the payment transaction is initiated using the Shopper Gateway.|Credit Debit, Cheque,  Check, Mobile, Reward, Electronic Voucher|
|Authorization without card identification|Specifies that the EFT tender immediately starts the payment flow or starts the flow with card identification and then continues with the payment flow.<BR>In 2 step EFT Credit/Debit Tender flows, in the 1st step, Emerald Global identifies the expected EFT card details without sending a payment amount, and in the 2nd step, initiates the payment process with an amount. There are many EPS providers who do not work in this manner and require that the payment amount is processed first.<BR>The options are:<BR><BR>**Yes** - When an EFT credit/debit card is scanned/swiped, the system starts the payment process immediately with an amount and a single authorization request with all the information including the balance due is sent to the EPS provider.<BR>**No** - A request is sent to identify the credit/debit card and then a request is sent to the EPS provider with the payment amount.|Credit Debit|

When a customer requests cashback, the POS prompts the cashier to enter the cashback amount sent via the EPS API.<BR>**Yes – Amount proposed by Provider** - indicates that a request for Cashback is defined by the provider. Emerald Global sends a request to the provider via the EPS API to indicate that the customer has requested cashback.|Credit Debit, Voucher|
|3rd Party Validations|The validations required by a third-party provider at the POS.<BR>**Note:** Each validation is an extension. The actual validation data is developed by Emerald Global Extension functionality.<BR>Emerald Global has an interface that is used to request and receive the required validation to complete such transactions at the POS.<BR>For example, the store may request that on receiving Cheques or Credit Cards, the customer ID number must be validated. The users must define all the 3rd Part Validators, which are populated in the 3rd Party Validators Picker.<BR>At the POS terminal, during the transaction, if the cashier tenders credit card, a message is prompted for the cashier to enter the information required to validate and complete the transaction.|Voucher, CreditDebit, Check, Cheque, Mobile, Reward, Point Payment, Electronic Voucher, Rounding|
|Combined Loyalty|Specifies that the tender is a combined credit/debit payment card and Loyalty card.<BR>When a combined Loyalty card is scanned at the POS, the POS sends a request to the external Loyalty provider to add the customer. The Loyalty Adapter identifies the combined card, extracts the Loyalty customer, and sends a response to the POS indicating if the customer is eligible for Loyalty and payment.<BR>After the cashier scans the customer’s items, on selecting a combined Loyalty tender, and the Loyalty card is eligible for payment, the POS continues with the payment flow without rescanning the card.<BR>If a Loyalty card has not been added to the transaction and the cashier selects a combined Loyalty tender, the POS prompts the Add Customer screen, and the cashier can add the Loyalty customer.|Credit/Debit|
|Continue Payment although Data Pattern not found|Specifies that on scanning or entering the card data, the POS searches for the Data Pattern and if a matching Data Pattern is not found for the barcode, the POS sends a payment to the EPS.<BR>When selected, if a Data Pattern is not found, the POS sends a request to the payment provider.<BR>When not selected, if a Data Pattern is not found, an error is prompted.|Credit/Debit|
|**Immediate Tendering Options**|Define how the balance due is tendered at the POS terminal. For example, when tendering cash, you can define the option to enter an open amount or use cash buttons to complete the transaction. In EFT tenders, you would define the system to immediately close after swiping the credit card.<BR>![Immediate Tendering Options](/Images/ImmediateTenderingOptions.png)||
|Tender Amount Required|The way the tender amounts are displayed at the POS when tendering with the selected tender.<BR>The options are:<BR><BR>**Open Amount** - The cashier must enter the amount the customer gives, e.g., if the balance due is $45.00, the cashier can enter any amount given by the customer.<BR>**Open Amount, Balance Due as Default** - The balance due is displayed by default on the screen in the 'Please Enter Amount Field', and the cashier can override the amount according to the amount paid by the customer. For example, if the balance due is $45.00, the cashier can either select OK to tender the exact amount, or enter any amount given by the customer.<BR>**Immediate Closing, Balance Due as Default** - indicates that the value is equal to the balance due, and by selecting the tender the POS accepts the tender amount and closes the transaction automatically. There is no additional window for approving the amount. For example, Credit Cards, after swiping the credit card, the balance due is accepted and the transaction is immediately closed.<BR>**Open Amount with Suggested Options** - indicates that different cash buttons are displayed, according to suggested options, for example, if you defined three suggested values, i.e., 50.00, 100.00, 150.00, and the balance due is $45.00, the options displayed are 45.00, 50.00, 100.00, 150.00. If the balance due is $55.00, the options displayed are 55.00, 100.00, and 150.00.<BR>**Note:** - An option to manually enter an amount in addition to the suggested amounts is always displayed at the POS.|Cash, Voucher, CreditDebit, Check, Cheque, Mobile, Reward, Point Payment, Electronic Voucher, Rounding|
|**Suggested Amounts Grid**|The suggested amounts grid is only available if **Open Amount with Suggest Options** is selected in the **Tender Amount Required** field.|Cash, Voucher, CreditDebit, Check, Cheque, Mobile, Reward, Point Payment, Electronic Voucher, Rounding|
|RowNo|The ID number automatically assigned by the system to the suggested amount line.||
|Round To|The suggested amounts buttons displayed at the POS. In addition to the default amounts, you specify additional suggested amounts as required.<BR>The options are:<BR><BR>Exact Amount - if the balance due is $2.50, a button with the amount of $2.50 is displayed.<BR>Manual - The cashier enters the amount given by the customer.<BR>The Exact Amount and Manual options are the default values and are always displayed at the POS.<BR>Round to the Nearest - The suggested amount button closest to the balance due is displayed. This option is automatically populated in the Round to field, when a value specifying the suggested amount value is entered in the Value field.||
|Value|The value of the suggested amount button displayed at the POS.  You can enter as many amounts as required. On entering an amount in the Value field, Round to the Nearest is automatically populated in the Round to field. For example, if you want to display buttons at the POS with the following amounts $10.00, $25.00, and $30.00, in the Value field, enter 10.00,||
|POS Display|Specifies if the suggested amount is displayed at the POS.||
|**Change Definitions**|Defines the change settings for each tender, when issuing change at the POS terminal. A change tender is the method of payment used to give change to the customer. For example, if the customer purchases perfume for the value of $350.00 and pays with a Gift Certificate with the value of $400.00, the cashier can only give the $50.00 change with the specified change tender.<BR>Retailers can use this functionality to specify that when paying with a Gift Certificate, the cashier can give the customer change with another Gift Certificate or specify that Gift Certificates must be used at the full value. This strategy forces the customer to spend the remaining amount in the store, as opposed to receiving change in cash which can be spent elsewhere.<BR>When the cashier performs a transaction and is required to issue the customer with change, the POS terminal displays only the change tenders defined for the method of payment used.<BR>![Change Definitions](/Images/ChangeDefinitions.png)|Cash, Voucher, CreditDebit, Check, Cheque, Mobile, Reward, Point Payment, Electronic Voucher, Rounding.|
|Consolidate On Change|Indicates if the change amounts for each tender are consolidated and displayed as one amount at the POS terminal.<BR>Default is No for all tenders except Rounding.<BR>For example, the customer purchased items for $120.00, and paid with $100.00 with cash, and requests to pay the rest with a credit card. Before tendering the credit card, the customer decides to pay the remaining amount with cash and gives the cashier another $100.00 in cash. The system consolidates the two cash amounts into one amount and displays the change due of $80.00 as one amount.||
|Disable Automatic Void|Indicates that the tender is automatically voided when there is more than one occurrence of a specific tender and change is required. This option can prevent a scenario when the customer has overpaid with a tender on which change cannot be given, e.g., vouchers.<BR>The options are:<BR><BR>**Yes** - the tender is not automatically voided.<BR>**No** – indicates that the tender is automatically voided.<BR>For example, the customer buys items for $120.00, and pays with three vouchers for $10.00, $50.00 and $70.00. The Change due is $10.00.<BR>If the Disable Automatic Void parameter is set to No, the $10.00 voucher is automatically voided.<BR>If set to Yes, the $10.00 voucher is not voided, and since change is not usually given on vouchers, the customer will not get change.|Cash|
|Priority|The priority that the POS terminal uses to issue change when there is more than one paid tender in a transaction.<BR>For example, if you paid by Voucher, and change is due, the system checks the change options according to the priorities defined. If cash was set up as priority 1 but defined that you can only give up to $10.00 in cash, and the amount owed is more than $10.00, the system checks the next tender in the list of priorities which is then issued as change.<BR>For example, the customer purchases items for $90.00, and pays $50.00 in cash and $100.00 with a voucher.<BR>The POS terminal checks the defined change options as follows:<BR>Cash: 1 - up to $5.00 can be issued as change.<BR>Voucher: 2 - up to $100.00 can be issued as change.<BR>Based on the defined priority, and change amounts, the customer receives $60.00 change as a voucher.|Cash|
|**Supplementary Details**|Defines additional information on certain tenders is required to complete the transaction.<BR>For example, EPS cards may be defined to require a Customer signature. When a customer pays with a credit card, the system prompts the cashier to request the customer's signature.<BR>![Supplementary Details](/Images/SupplementaryDetails.png)||
|Signature Required|The method used to verify the customer's signature when a customer signature is required in EFT card transactions. Once the customer's credit card is scanned, a slip is printed and the customer is required to sign. The cashier must then verify the signature.<BR>The options are:<BR><BR>**Verification** - The cashier must verify that the customer's signature on the slip is correct. Once confirmed, the cashier must enter Yes to continue to the transaction. If the signature is not verified, and the cashier selects No, the transaction is cancelled.<BR>**Acknowledgement** - The cashier is only required to acknowledge the customer's signature. The cashier then selects OK to continue the transaction. The transaction cannot be cancelled.|Voucher, CreditDebit, Check, Cheque, Mobile, Reward, Point Payment, Electronic Voucher, Rounding|
|**Cash Office**|Defines the tender configuration for cash office activities.<BR>![Cash Office](/Images/CashOffice.png)|Voucher, CreditDebit, Check, Cheque, Mobile, Reward, Point Payment, Electronic Voucher, Rounding|
|Auto Reconciliation|Indicates that the tender is automatically declared by the system. The system calculates and declares the tender amounts without actually counting the tender.||
|Use Denomination|Indicates that the tender amounts are entered by denomination when the tender is recorded in a Cash Office Activity||
|Activities|The Cash Office Activities for which you want to record denominations.<BR>If no activities are selected, then the cashier is required to enter the denominations used in all cash office activities.||
|Use Individual  Instance|Indicates that on adding vouchers for a new activity or adjustment, each voucher can be manually entered without having to calculate the total amount.<br>As each voucher and amount are entered, the total voucher amount is updated with the correct amount.<br>On selecting OK, the Enter Vouchers screen is closed and the Voucher amount field in the Transaction Tender List is updated with the total voucher amount.<br>The individual voucher amounts are not saved anywhere after saving the transaction.<br>This also applies when adjusting the tender voucher amount with the ‘Use Individual Instance’ configuration.||
|**Reward Accounting**|Defines reward accounting methods in promotions for reconciliation purposes. <BR>![Reward Accounting](/Images/RewardAccounting.png)|	Voucher, CreditDebit, Check, Cheque, Mobile, Reward, Point Payment, Electronic Voucher, Rounding|
|Reduces Items Refund Price|Indicates that the tender amount reduces the item’s refund price in a Transaction Based Return. This is used for reconciliation purposes with the vendor, and prevents the retailer from giving back the reward amount twice, i.e., to both the customer and to the vendor.||
|**Tender EPS Reference**|Connects credit/debit cards Tenders to the payment providers that can authorize payment and process the transaction.<BR>**Note:** **Tender EPS Reference** is enabled only when **Process with EPS** is selected in the **Authorization Method** field in the **Basic Definitions** section.<BR>![Tender EPS Reference](/Images/TenderEPSReference.png)|Credit Debit, Check / Cheque, Points Payment, Mobile, Electronic Voucher|
