### Alert Template Setup

**Alert Template Setup** defines the templates for alerts which are manually triggered at the POS terminal.

An Alert Template is a set of predefined fields, which defines the severity level, the message displayed and the Alert Group.

For example, you can set up an alert template for when the cashier wishes to take a break from the POS terminal. When the alert is triggered at the POS terminal, the supervisor can view the alert in the Store Manager, and then handle the alert accordingly.

The Alert Template defines the alert severity level, as well as define the message displayed when the alert is triggered. The message is displayed in the language linked to the culture assigned in the Store Manager. For example, if the Store Manager is linked to the US Eng culture, the message is displayed in English, even when the POS the message was sent from is assigned to a different culture.
