### DMS Servers

**DMS (Data Movement Services) Servers** displays the servers used to move store data through the system. The DMS is the engine behind the scenes which delivers and applies changes to the store and the POS terminals. For example, the store manager may make a change in the Store Office, e.g., add a new device, the DMS handles the process behind the scenes, and sends the changes to the POS terminal. The POS terminal then applies the changes.
