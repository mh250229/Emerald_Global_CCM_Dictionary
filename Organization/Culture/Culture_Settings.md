## Culture Settings

*Culture Settings* define the language, currency, date format and weights and measures used in a region or country. Different settings can be configured for different cultures. For example, the date format for English (United Kingdom) is different to the date format used by English (United States).

Once you define the culture settings, if you have a Resource file translated into the language of the defined culture, the system applies the relevant language defined in the Resource file.

Touchpoints connected to the Emerald Global Server inherit the culture settings for their specific region or country.

For example, the default language for stores in Montreal is French, and the stores are linked to the Canada(FR) culture. In addition to the language, you can specify the date format, currency, and weights and measures settings relevant to the Canada(FR) culture. The settings will be applied to each store linked to the Canada(FR) culture.

Culture settings are distributed through the system using Emerald Globalâ€™s DMS (data management services).

**Note:** Culture Settings must be defined before a store is opened. Once the store is live, Culture Settings cannot be defined.
