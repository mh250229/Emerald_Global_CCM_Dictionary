## Device Types

**Device Types** categorize devices according to types.  Each device type includes error codes and the correlated alert template that is triggered on each device, as well as the methods used to handle the alert.

Once the Device Type is linked to a device, the defined attributes are automatically applied to the device. This enables retailers to apply the relevant alerts to similar type devices without configuring the alerts for each specific device.
