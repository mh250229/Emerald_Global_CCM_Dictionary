## Roles

Roles sets up the user roles (job types) in the system, for example, Administrator, Cashier, Cash Officer, and so on. Roles are based on the available roles in the business.

Every role can be assigned role actions. When creating Roles you can define the roles actions to which each role has access, and specify the activities that can be performed by each role action.

For example:

A Role can be created for the Supervisor and another role for a Cash Officer. You can specify that the Supervisor can perform all the Cash Office actions, Sales and Return transactions as well as change, or reset a userâ€™s password. While the Cash Officer can only perform Bank Deposits and Safe Declarations.

Once the Roles are defined, you can associate users to the Roles.
