## Stores

**Stores** is used to add, view or modify stores in the system.

When a store is setup, it is linked to a store hierarchy and added to a specific group within a chain of stores. The hierarchy is the classification of a group of stores according to your store's policy. Some may define the hierarchy according to the storesâ€™ zone or maybe size.

In addition, you can link stores to touchpoint groups and specify that a touchpoint group such as self-checkout is part of a defined store.
