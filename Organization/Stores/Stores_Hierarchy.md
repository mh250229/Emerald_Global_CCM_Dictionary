## Stores Hierarchy

**Stores Hierarchy** is used to set up store hierarchies. You can build levels within the hierarchy to which groups of stores can be added. It is most useful when you have a multi-chain store where stores can be grouped into categories giving you more control over the whole setup. The hierarchy is the classification of a group of stores according to your store's policy. Hierarchies can be defined according to the store's zone, size, etc.

For example: You may setup a hierarchy called CHAIN VIEW, which is divided into a smaller group, such as HIGH/LOW COMPETITION STORES. You divide it into smaller groups, one for high competition stores, located in central areas, and another for low competition stores, which may be located in remote areas. You could then divide LOW COMPETITION STORES into another smaller group called, Fast Food Outlets and Home Delivery Outlets. You would then link the various stores to the relevant groups.
Stores are defined and linked to the hierarchy in **Business Units/Stores**.
