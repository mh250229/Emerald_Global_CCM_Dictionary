## Office Menu 

**Office Menu** is used to create specific Office Menus in addition to the system default menu. Office Menus displays the modules in the Store Manager. Once you have created a new Office Menu, you can then link the menu to a specific role. When a user linked to the role signs into the Store Manager, the system displays the menu linked to the user's role.

In addition, you can customize an Office Menu by creating a new tab which can include any of the modules in the default system menu.

**Note:** Users can only see menus to which they have permission. If a user tries to access a menu to which they do not have access by entering a URL, the system prompts an error.
