## PLU Groups

**PLU Groups** are used to build custom PLU groups and subgroups. PLU Groups comprise items grouped for easy selection and recognition, e.g., heavy items, items with no barcodes, fruit, vegetables, bakery products and so on.

For example, a customer purchases a carton of Diet Cokes. The carton is too big to pick up to enable the cashier to scan the barcode, therefore, the cashier can select the item from the relevant PLU Group.

You can also define subgroups within PLU Groups, and add items to the subgroups.

When selecting a PLU Group at a touchpoint, e.g., POS, Self Checkout, QSR, etc., a screen with buttons is displayed. Each button represents a PLU Group, and displays the PLU Group name as well as an image to symbolize the PLU Group.

PLU Groups are set up for specific business units and then linked to different PLU Menus.

After a PLU Menu is set up, you can assign the menu to selected business units, touchpoint groups and touchpoints.
