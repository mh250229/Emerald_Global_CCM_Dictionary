## PLU Menu Assignments

**PLU Menu Assignment** links PLU Menus to touchpoints and touchpoints groups in the stores. PLU Menus consist of PLU Groups and define the order the PLU Groups are displayed on a touchpoint.

Once a PLU Menu is set up, you can link the menu to the stores, touchpoint groups and touchpoints on which you want to display the PLU Menu. A PLU Menu can be assigned to different stores and touchpoints, however, can only be assigned once to the same combination of Business Units, Touchpoint types and Touchpoint groups.

PLU Menus can also be inherited. If a PLU Menu was not assigned to a specific Business Unit, Touchpoint Type and Touchpoint Group combination, the system applies the PLU Menu of the next closest of combination, if defined.

For example, if a PLU Menu is defined for a region it will be applied to all the relevant POS touchpoints linked to the region that have not been assigned a PLU Menu, without actually assigning the PLU Menu to the touchpoint.
