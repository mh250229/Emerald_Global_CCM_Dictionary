## Tender Menu

**Tender Menus** define the Tender Menu displayed at the touchpoints when tendering a transaction. Different Tender menus can be defined for each touchpoint. The tenders in the menu are displayed by name, and an image can be added if required.

|**Field**|**Description**|
|---------|----------|
|Location|The business unit for which you want to define the Tender|
|Touchpoint Group Type|The touchpoint group type to display the menu. **Primary Touchpoint Groups** or **Secondary Touchpoint Groups**.<BR>For example, all POS touchpoints are assigned to the same Primary Touchpoint Group, however, some of the POS touchpoints may require a different Tender menu. Those POS touchpoints are assigned to a Secondary Touchpoint Group, and the Tender Menu configuration is assigned to the Secondary Touchpoint Group only. The menu configuration is then applied only to the touchpoints in the Secondary Touchpoint Group and not to all the touchpoints in the Primary Touchpoint Group.|
|Touchpoint Group|The specific touchpoint group in the selected Business Group for which you want to define the Tender menu.|
|Touchpoint Type|The touchpoint type in the selected touchpoint group for which you want to define the Tender menu. The options are:<BR>POS, Self Scan Device, Self Scan EU, Self Checkout, Fuel POS, Unknown.|
|Version|The HQ server version you want to configure or view the Tender Menu for. The current HQ version is displayed by default.<BR>When a retailer upgrades their stores to a new Emerald Global version, they are able to maintain the Tender Menu configuration for both the old and the new versions so that the stores with the old version may still use the old configuration plus any updates that apply to all the stores, and stores with the new version are able to use an updated configuration that many include new features.<BR>For example, if a new Tender is added in Version 10.11, but is not supported in Version 10.10, the retailer can have different data in the Tender command menu in the different versions.<BR>One or more versions are supported.<BR>If only one version is displayed, for example, 10.11.0.0, all the data was upgraded to the current version (e.g. 10.11) and any old data was deleted.<BR>If two versions are displayed, for example, 10.11.0.0 and 10.10.0.0,  HQ was upgraded (e.g. 10.11) but some of the data (or the entire data) is on an older version (e.g. 10.10).<BR>If three or more versions are displayed, for example, 10.11.0.0, 10.10.0.0 and 10.9.0.0, HQ was updated but some of the data is on an older version (10.10) and another data is on a different older version (e.g. 10.9).<BR>To select a version, from the Version drop-down list select the version for which you want to view or update data the Tender Menu. You can view or update the menus for the current and older versions.<BR>**Note:** The drop down displays the version naming: 10.11.0.0, 10.10.0.0, 10.9.0.0, etc. It is assumed the user making the changes is familiar with the version naming.|
