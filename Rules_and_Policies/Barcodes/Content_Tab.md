### Warm Reboot Data Pattern Type

The **Warm Reboot** data pattern type enables you to manually (warm) reboot a device whilst it is still locked in the cradle, by scanning a barcode. A warm reboot operation clears the device's memory.

This is useful when it is required to handle cases where remote operations are not effective. A warm reboot clears the device's program memory.

A data pattern is defined in the system, which when scanned triggers the reboot operation. Once a reboot is completed, the device is fully operational.

The Warm Reboot data pattern type is a fixed barcode and does not have content parameters

### Release Device Data Pattern Type

The Release Device data pattern type enables you to manually release a device from the cradle.

A data pattern is defined for the release operation. While the device is locked in the cradle, the user can slightly lift the device, and return it to the charger. This operation should trigger the device to scan the cradle barcode, which is located above the device. On scanning the Release Device barcode instead of the Cradle barcode, the device is released from the cradle. After a few seconds, the cradle is locked.

The Release Device data pattern type is a fixed barcode and does not have content parameters.

### User Credentials Data Pattern Type

The **User Credentials** data pattern type enables you to define the data pattern used when an employee scans their card when logging in to the system. The system identifies the user's ID and password and enables users to log in without manually entering their credentials.

**Note:** In addition to the User Credential data pattern, the Cashier and User data patterns can also used to identify users. The User data pattern is the most secure as once the barcode is scanned, the user is still required to enter their password. The Cashier data pattern is less secure, although the user still has to enter their cashier reference. The User Credential data pattern is the least secure as once the barcode is scanned, the user ID and password are identified by the system and the user can access the system without any further identification.

### Blind Pickup Data Pattern Type

The **Blind Pickup** data pattern type is used to retrieve Blind Pick up information. A Blind Pickup is performed by the cashier when the amount of cash in the drawer exceeds a specified limit. The cashier removes the money from the drawer without counting the money, and the money is transferred to the Cash Office to be counted and transferred to the safes. When Blind Pickup is performed, a slip is generated with a barcode. The barcode data pattern includes information such as the pickup type and lift number, as well as the date the pickup was performed and the POS touchpoint on which the pickup was performed.

![Blind Pickup Type](/Images/BlindPickupType.png)

![Online Services Profile Data Pattern Type](/Images/OnlineServicesProfileDataPatternType.png)

|**Field**|**Description**|
|---------|----------|
|Profile ID|The ID of the provider authorizing the online item.<BR>**Fixed** Defines a specific Profile ID in the data pattern. Fixed is the default value.<BR>*Fixed Value* - The Profile ID number|

### Group Data Pattern Type

The **Group** data pattern type is used to define Online Purchase Group information. This data pattern types points to the group. In a scenario in which the group is an online purchase group, when the data pattern is identified, the list of items attached to the group are presented at the POS.

![Group Data Pattern Type](/Images/GroupDataPatternType.png)

|**Field**|**Description**|

Fixed is the default value.<BR>*Fixed Value* - The group ID number|

### User Data Pattern Type

The User data pattern type enables you to define user barcodes to identify users. When the user barcode is scanned at the POS, the user’s code is extracted from the barcode and the user’s information is retrieved to identify the user.  For example, the cashier arrives at work, swipes their employee card. The system identifies the User’s code from the barcode and prompts the user to enter their password to continue working on the system.

In addition, if the customer has a specific convention when defining users in the system, the user barcodes can be manipulated so that the user code matches the customer code convention as it appears in the user database. When the user barcode is scanned at the POS, the correct user is identified.  This is required when a retailer creates their own barcodes for their users to comply with an external employee system.

**Note:** In addition to the User data pattern, the Cashier and User Credentials data patterns can also used to identify users. The User data pattern is the most secure as once the barcode is scanned, the user is still required to enter their password. The Cashier data pattern is less secure, although the user still has to enter their cashier reference. The User Credentials data pattern is the least secure as once the barcode is scanned, the user ID and password are identified by the system and the user can access the system without any further identification.

### Cashier Data Pattern Type

The **Cashier** data pattern type is used to define the data pattern used to allow cashiers, supervisors or attendants to sign in by scanning a barcode instead of using their user name and password. The data pattern includes an embedded Reference ID assigned by the system to ensure the cashier barcode is unique.

A Cashier Barcode is printed after the cashier signs in to the POS touchpoint with a user name and password, the cashier selects the **Cashier Barcode** button. A unique barcode is printed and assigned to the cashier. The cashier can then use this barcode to sign in to the touchpoint. Each time the cashier prints a new barcode, the new barcode overrides the previous one.

A Staff Barcode is printed after the Cashier or supervisor selects the Staff Barcode button and enables supervisors and attendants to print an Authentication Barcode Slip without having to log in to the POS as is required today when printing a Cashier Barcode. An authentication barcode is used to initiate authentication of the user. For example, on selling an age restricted item that requires supervisor approval, or a Business Rule triggered during an activity that requires supervisor approval, the user can scan a barcode that initiates the authentication of the user who is approving the activity. The authentication barcode is valid for a defined period (configurable). The cashier or supervisor selects the Staff Barcode option.

### IMEI Data Pattern Type

The **IMEI** data pattern type is used to define specific mobile information, such as the IMEI number.

IMEI number (International Mobile Equipment Identity) is a 15 or 17 digit unique number to identify mobile devices, as well as some other devices. It is usually found printed on the back of phones under the battery. It can also be displayed on the phones screen by entering *#06# on the phones keypad.
The IMEI number is structured by the BABT (British Approvals Board for Telecommunications). It has 15 decimal digits (14 + 1 check digit). The first 8 digits in an IMEI are the TAC (Type Allocation Code), which gives you the mobile phone brand and model. The other 7 digits are defined by the manufacturer (6 are serial numbers and 1 is a check digit).
From 2004, the IMEI format is AA BBBBBB CCCCCC D
TAC SERIAL CHECK DIGIT
AA BBBBBB CCCCCC D
In any of the above cases, the first two digits of the TAC are the Reporting Body Identifier, which identifies the GSMA-approved group that allocated the TAC.
The RBI numbers are allocated by the Global Decimal Administrator.
The first two digits are always decimal (i.e., less than 0xA0), allowing IMEI numbers to be distinguished from an MEID, which will always have 0xA0 or larger as its first two digits.
Example of an IMEI number:
35 780502 398494 2, where:
	35 is the reporting body identifier.
	780502 is the manufacturer and brand (phone type)
	398494 is the serial number
	2 is the check digit
Check Digits: The 15th or the last number of the IMEI is a check digit. The Check Digit is calculated according to Luhn formula, using the other digits in the IMEI.
The purpose of the Check Digit is to help guard against the possibility of incorrect entries to the CEIR and EIR equipment.
The check digit is validated in three steps:
1.	Starting from the right, double a digit every two digits (e.g., 7 → 14).
2.	Sum the digits (e.g., 14 → 1 + 4).
3.	Check if the sum is divisible by 10.
Conversely, one can calculate the IMEI by choosing the check digit that would give a sum divisible by 10.
In the following example, the IMEI is 35 780502 398494 ?
IMEI number 3 5 7 8 0 5 0 2 3 9 8 4 9 4 ?
Double every other digit 3 10 7 16 0 10 0 4 3 18 8 8 9 8 ?
