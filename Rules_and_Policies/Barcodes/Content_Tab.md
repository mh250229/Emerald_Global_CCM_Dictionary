|**Item ID**|The GS1 Databar Item code. Items in GS1 are identified based on a specific application identifier: GTIN (01). On scanning or keying in a GS1 Databar, the system extracts the GTIN from the barcode and identifies the item in the catalog.<BR>**Position** The position in the data pattern from which the Item ID begins in the data pattern.<br>**Length** The number of digits in the Item ID.<br>**Strip Leading Zeros** Indicates that leading zeros in the Item ID are not considered in the validation, and the system validates the Item ID without the zeros.|

### Warm Reboot Data Pattern Type

The **Warm Reboot** data pattern type enables you to manually (warm) reboot a device whilst it is still locked in the cradle, by scanning a barcode. A warm reboot operation clears the device's memory.

This is useful when it is required to handle cases where remote operations are not effective. A warm reboot clears the device's program memory.

A data pattern is defined in the system, which when scanned triggers the reboot operation. Once a reboot is completed, the device is fully operational.

The Warm Reboot data pattern type is a fixed barcode and does not have content parameters

### Release Device Data Pattern Type

The Release Device data pattern type enables you to manually release a device from the cradle.

A data pattern is defined for the release operation. While the device is locked in the cradle, the user can slightly lift the device, and return it to the charger. This operation should trigger the device to scan the cradle barcode, which is located above the device. On scanning the Release Device barcode instead of the Cradle barcode, the device is released from the cradle. After a few seconds, the cradle is locked.

The Release Device data pattern type is a fixed barcode and does not have content parameters.

### User Credentials Data Pattern Type

The **User Credentials** data pattern type enables you to define the data pattern used when an employee scans their card when logging in to the system. The system identifies the user's ID and password and enables users to log in without manually entering their credentials.

**Note:** In addition to the User Credential data pattern, the Cashier and User data patterns can also used to identify users. The User data pattern is the most secure as once the barcode is scanned, the user is still required to enter their password. The Cashier data pattern is less secure, although the user still has to enter their cashier reference. The User Credential data pattern is the least secure as once the barcode is scanned, the user ID and password are identified by the system and the user can access the system without any further identification.
