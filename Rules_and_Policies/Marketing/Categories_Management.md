## Categories Management

**Categories Management** enables you to create promotion categories that group promotions and target them to specific customers. After you define a category, you can link a promotion to it.

For example, the Buy 1 Ice Cream Get 1 Free promotion can be linked to the Kids, Summer and Dairy categories. The promotion is offered to all members linked to one of those categories.

On setting up a promotion, you can select promotion categories you want to link to the promotion.
