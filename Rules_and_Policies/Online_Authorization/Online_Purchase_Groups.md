## Online Purchase Groups

**Online Purchase Groups** define the different providers, communication settings and item groups required when selling online items such as gift cards. An online item is any item that requires the 3rd party authorization during the sale process.

For example, if you sell gift cards in the store, you set up an online purchase group for gift cards and the relevant provider.

Online Purchase Groups represent a profile of online items as follows:

* Online Items that are sold under the same conditions, e.g., the item code is scanned, and the item is then sold.
* Online Items that are linked by specific external identification, e.g., a plan code. The plan code is scanned, and a list of the online items in the plan is displayed. The cashier then selects the relevant item from the list.
