## Return Policies

Return Policies allows you to define your policy as how to handle items returned to store by customers. Return Policies can be managed centrally from head office. The Central Returns solution provides central management with all return transactions, and determines if items can be returned, when the items can be returned, and specific rules preventing items from being returned for different reasons. For example: Not accepting the return of an item after its return expiry date. It also supports multi stores, enabling shoppers to purchase items in one store and return them at another store within the chain, while complying with defined return policies and rules.

The Central Management solution enables tighter control on all return transactions and security. Different options to prevent fraud are available in the suite of functions offered in the Return Policies module. In addition, a range of functionality is available to make it easy for a customer to return items they do not want, or defective, etc.

Different return policies types can be defined, each with its own details and restrictions. You can define Return Policies associated with a business unit in the organization.

Return Policies must be defined for each type of return transaction. Once defined, the Return Policy is submitted and is active. Multiple return policies of the same type can be defined and submitted, however, only one policy is active at a time. The system validates the activation dates of each submitted policy, and applies the policy with the current date. For example, when customers return items, the system validates the return date against the item purchase date. If a Return Policy was defined on January 1, and another Return Policy of the same type was defined and submitted on February 1, and the customer returns items purchased before February 1, the returned items are validated against the Return Policy defined on January 1.

Return Policy types include:

* **Non Receipted** - to define general refund policy details for all transactions in which items are returned without a receipt.
* **Transaction Based** - to define general refund policy details for all transactions in which items are returned with a receipt.
* **Return All** - to define general refund policy details for returns in which all the items in the transaction are returned. The system validates if the items on the receipt are returnable. If one item on the receipt is not returnable, the return transaction cannot be performed. If the items are all returnable, the cashier does not have to scan the items, and the full transaction is recorded as a return transaction.
* **Gift Receipt Redemption** - to define general refund policy details for the return of an item purchased as a gift. A Gift Receipt is printed when an item is purchased as a gift, and enables the gift recipient to exchange or return the item without the main sale receipt.
* **Bottle Deposit** - to define a refund policy when empty bottles are returned to refund the deposit amount.

For example: The store has a Return Policy for returns based on a transaction. The Return Policy includes rules that specify that the customer cannot return an item after a defined number of days since the item was purchased, or if the packaging is damaged, the item can only be exchanged, etc. On returning the item, the cashier scans the receipt, if the return date exceeds the defined number of days since the original date of purchase, the item cannot be returned.

Users can define Return Policies for future dates, which would be pending until activated.

**Note:** If a Return Policy is not defined for a return type, the specific returns cannot be performed. For example, if a return policy is not defined for Non Receipted returns, then return transactions without a receipt cannot be performed.
