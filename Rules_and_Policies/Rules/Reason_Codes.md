## Reason Codes

**Reason Codes** define the reason codes selected when an activity is performed on the touchpoints and indicate the reason the activity was performed.

For example, when the cashier performs a Price Override, the system prompts the cashier to enter the reason the item price was overridden.

Reason Codes are not defined for specific Business Units.
